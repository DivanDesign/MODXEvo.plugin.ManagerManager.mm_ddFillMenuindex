# mm_ddFillMenuindex

A widget for the ManagerManager plugin that was made to keep “menuindex” in order:
1. “menuindex” of a new document is set equal to a free minimal value within its parent (“menuindex”, by default, used to be the number of siblings which was not always preferred).
2. “menuindex” is incremented automatically by 1 on document duplicate.
